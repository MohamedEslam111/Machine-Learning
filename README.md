# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

---

## 1️⃣ Problem Definition
We first define the business or research problem clearly.  
This step sets the goal and scope of the project and makes sure the team knows what needs to be solved.

---

## 2️⃣ Data Collection
Gather relevant and reliable datasets from various sources.  
Good data is the foundation of a strong machine learning model.

---

## 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, scaling numbers, and encoding categorical variables.  
This ensures the data is ready for analysis.

---

## 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use statistics and visualizations to explore the dataset.  
Helps in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships in data.

---

## 5️⃣ Feature Engineering
Create or select the most important features.  
This step reduces complexity and improves model performance.

---

## 6️⃣ Model Selection & Training
Choose the right algorithm (e.g., regression, decision tree, neural network).  
Train the model on historical data to learn patterns.

---

## 7️⃣ Evaluation & Tuning
Test the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
Adjust hyperparameters to improve performance.

---

## 8️⃣ Deployment
Integrate the trained model into real applications so it can make predictions and provide value in practice.

---

## 9️⃣ Monitoring
Keep track of the model’s performance after deployment.  
Update or retrain the model when accuracy decreases over time.
