# Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a process that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.  
It follows several steps to ensure accuracy and reliability of models.

## Steps of Machine Learning

The steps are:  
1- Problem Definition  
2- Data Collection  
3- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
4- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5- Feature Engineering and Selection  
6- Model Selection  
7- Model Training  
8- Model Evaluation and Tuning  
9- Model Deployment  
10- Model Monitoring and Maintenance

### Step 1: Problem Definition
Identify and frame the business problem clearly.  
Define objectives, desired outcomes, and scope to build a solid foundation for the project.

---

### Step 2: Data Collection
Gather relevant and high-quality data from different sources.  
The quality and quantity of data directly affect model performance.

---

### Step 3: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Clean raw data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
Preprocess by scaling, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing formats for better analysis.

---

### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use statistical and visualization tools to explore data.  
Find hidden patterns, trends, and relationships to support feature engineering and model selection.

---

### Step 5: Feature Engineering and Selection
Create or transform features to improve model accuracy.  
Select only the most relevant features to reduce complexity and boost performance.

---

### Step 6: Model Selection
Choose the best algorithm that fits the problem and data.  
Consider accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and test different models for the best fit.

---

### Step 7: Model Training
Train the chosen model using historical data.  
The model learns patterns and relationships through iterative optimization.

---

### Step 8: Model Evaluation and Tuning
Test the model on unseen data with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  
Tune hyperparameters to enhance performance and reliability.

---

### Step 9: Model Deployment
Integrate the trained model into real-world applications.  
Use it for predictions and decision-making in business or systems.

---

### Step 10: Model Monitoring and Maintenance
Continuously track model performance after deployment.  
Update or retrain as data and requirements evolve to keep accuracy high.
